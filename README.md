# predicting-blood-donation-
- predicting blood donation with machine learning technics.
- this dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. I want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.
- in this project, I have used the TPOT library that uses genetic programming to find the best pipeline and hyperparameters for the ML model.
